    <h1>Individual Conferences</h1>

    <p>This semester, I'm doing something a little different for Project 1 feedback: instead of only written comments, we'll meet one-on-one so I can read your paper, talk through it with you, and give you feedback in real time. This is a chance for us to have a real conversation about your writing — we can talk through your ideas, how the draft came together, and figure out together what's working, what could be stronger, and how to approach your final revision for the portfolio. It's also a space for you to ask questions about your paper, your writing process, or anything else related to the project.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Conferences will be available either in person or over Zoom. When it gets closer, you'll sign up for a time slot — I'll share the sign-up details on Canvas.</p>
    <p>During the conference, I'll read through your revised draft and we'll talk about it together — what you were going for, what's working, and where there might be room to grow. We'll work through ideas for strengthening your final revision, and you're encouraged to ask questions and bring up anything you're unsure about.</p>

    <h2>Before Your Conference</h2>
    <p>You <strong>must</strong> have the following submitted on Canvas <strong>before</strong> your scheduled conference time — no exceptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your <a href="/assignments/revised-draft.html">Revised Draft</a></li>
      <li>Your <a href="/assignments/reflection.html">Self-Evaluation &amp; Reflection Form</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>If either submission is missing at the time of your conference, we will not be able to meet.</p>

    <h2>What to Bring</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A notebook and pen</strong> — to jot down feedback and any ideas that come up during our conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Questions</strong> — if there's anything about your paper or writing process you want to discuss, this is a great time to ask.</li>
    </ul>

      <h3>Recording &amp; Keeping Track of Feedback</h3>
      <p>You are welcome to record the session (audio or screen recording) if that would help you remember the feedback. Whether you record or take notes, make sure you have a way to refer back to what we discussed — this feedback is what will guide your final revision for the portfolio, and I won't be able to recall the specifics of each individual conversation later in the semester. Taking good notes during the conference is one of the best things you can do to set yourself up for a strong final revision.</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>The individual conference is not a separate graded item — it is how you receive feedback on your revised draft. However, it is a required part of Project 1, and your Project 1 grades will not be released until your conference is complete. If an emergency comes up and you need to reschedule, reach out to me as soon as possible so we can find another time. See the <a href="/assignments/research-paper-overview.html#grading">Project 1 Grade Breakdown</a> for the full breakdown of Project 1 components.</p>
