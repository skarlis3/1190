    <h2 id="revision">Revising Your Draft</h2>

    <p>After receiving feedback from peer review (or your ASC tutor visit), your next step is to revise your draft with a focus on the ideas and structure of your paper. This means looking at how your argument is organized, whether your points are fully developed, and how well your sources work together to support your claims.</p>

    <p>Some questions to guide your revision:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Does the overall organization of your paper make sense? Are your ideas presented in a logical order?</li>
      <li>Are your body paragraphs fully developed with enough analysis and evidence?</li>
      <li>Are you putting your sources in conversation with each other, or just summarizing them one at a time?</li>
      <li>Do your paragraphs connect to each other with transitions, or does the paper feel choppy?</li>
      <li>Does your introduction set up the paper clearly, and does your conclusion bring your argument together?</li>
      <li>Are you using all three required source types (public conversations, news articles, and scholarly articles) effectively?</li>
      <li>Did your peer reviewers flag anything that you haven't addressed yet?</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>This Is a Second Draft, Not a Final Draft</h3>
      <p>You will have more opportunities to improve this paper. After submitting this revised draft, you will meet with me for an <a href="/assignments/conferences.html">individual conference</a> where I'll give you direct feedback on your paper. At the end of the semester, you will revise this paper one more time as part of your <b>Final Portfolio</b>.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">So for this draft, focus on making meaningful revisions to your ideas, organization, flow, and structure. It doesn't need to be perfect &mdash; but it should show real progress from your rough draft.</p>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <h2 id="requirements-detail">Full Requirements</h2>

    <p>Your revised draft must meet all of the following. These are the same content requirements from the <a href="/assignments/research-paper-overview.html">Research Paper Overview</a>, plus the expectation that your draft has been meaningfully revised after peer review.</p>

    <h3>Revision</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Revise based on peer review feedback.</b> Your revised draft should show clear changes to the ideas, organization, structure, and/or development of your paper based on the feedback you received. Simply fixing typos or grammar does not count as revision for this assignment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Content and Evidence</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Required topics:</b> Your paper should identify how AI is being used in your chosen field, explain what people in the field are saying about it, put different types of sources in conversation, and make a clear, focused argument or main point. See the <a href="/assignments/research-paper-overview.html#task">Research Paper Overview</a> for the full breakdown.</li>
      <li><b>Required sources:</b> Your paper must use all three required source types:
        <ul>
          <li>Public conversations (at least 2)</li>
          <li>News articles (at least 2)</li>
          <li>Peer-reviewed scholarly articles (at least 4)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Support your claims:</b> Throughout your paper, support your claims using evidence from your sources. Put sources in conversation with each other rather than summarizing them in isolation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Citations and Formatting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Length:</b> 2000 words minimum (~7&ndash;10 pages), not including the title page or References.</li>
      <li><b>Format:</b> APA Style.</li>
      <li><b>Title page:</b> APA format.</li>
      <li><b>In-text citations:</b> APA style for all quoted, paraphrased, or summarized material.</li>
      <li><b>References page:</b> Separate APA References page with entries for all sources cited in the paper.</li>
      <li><b>AI Statement of Use:</b> A detailed AI Statement of Use is required at the end of your paper. See the <a href="#ai">AI Statement of Use</a> section below.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <!--  AI STATEMENT                                                -->
    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <h2 id="ai">AI Statement of Use</h2>

    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h3>Required for All Students</h3>
      <p>Include a detailed AI Statement of Use at the end of your paper, regardless of whether you used AI or not.</p>
      <p><b>If you did not use GenAI:</b> State that you did not use GenAI in any capacity.</p>
      <p><b>If you used GenAI in any capacity</b>, your statement must include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which AI tool was used (e.g., ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, etc.)</li>
        <li>Which pages or paragraphs the AI assisted with</li>
        <li>What specific tasks the AI helped you with for those sections (e.g., brainstorming, revising for clarity, proofreading, finding sources)</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">You may use GenAI to help write your AI Statement of Use, but you are responsible for making sure it is accurate and truthful.</p>
