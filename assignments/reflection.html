    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Complete Before Your Conference</h3>
      <p>You must complete this self-evaluation and reflection <strong>before</strong> your <a href="/assignments/conferences.html">individual conference</a> with me. We will use your responses as a starting point for discussing your revised draft for Project 1.</p>
