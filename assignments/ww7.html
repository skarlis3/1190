    <h1>Weekly Writing 7</h1>
    <h2>Prewriting & Developing Your Working Outline</h2>

    <!-- Requirements -->
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Length:</b> Varies (likely about 250–400 words total combined across both parts), plus any AI conversation transcript if applicable<br/>
      <b>Genre:</b> Brainstorming + working outline<br/>
      <b>Assignment AI Policy:</b> AI may be used for parts of this assignment. See additional information in Part 1 and Part 2 below.
    </p>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Now that you have read scholarly articles and gathered additional research, your next step is to begin shaping these ideas into an organized plan you can build on when drafting your paper. This is not a final outline — it's the foundation for your drafting process.</p>

    <!-- At a Glance -->
    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h3>What You're Submitting</h3>
      <p><b>Part 1 — Brainstorming:</b> Complete <b>one</b> of three options (freewrite, Big 3 Questions, or AI conversation).</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><b>Part 2 — Working Outline:</b> A flexible, in-progress outline with your field, working thesis, subtopics, and sources. Must include an AI Transparency Statement.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <h2 id="part1">Part 1: Brainstorming</h2>
    <p>Select the method that helps you organize your thinking best. You only need to complete <b>one</b> of the three options below — open the one you want to use.</p>

    <!-- Option 1 -->
    <details>
      <summary>Option 1: Freewrite (8–10 minutes)</summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p>Write continuously for 8–10 minutes about your developing paper topic. You can handwrite this and upload a clear photo (make sure it is not blurry), or you can type it.</p>
        <p>Use prompts like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What seems to matter most about how AI is impacting your field?</li>
          <li>What themes keep showing up in your scholarly, news, or social media sources?</li>
          <li>What problems, controversies, or opportunities do you see?</li>
          <li>What do you think your paper will need to explain or argue?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep this informal — just get your ideas on the page.</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- Option 2 -->
    <details>
      <summary>Option 2: Big 3 Questions</summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p>Answer the following questions in complete but informal sentences:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Main claim or purpose:</b> What do you think your main claim or purpose might be?</li>
          <li><b>Major points:</b> What 2–4 major points could help you explain or support that claim?</li>
          <li><b>Connected sources:</b> Which of your sources seem connected to each of those major points?</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- Option 3 -->
    <details>
      <summary>Option 3: Generative AI Conversation for Idea Development</summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p>Use an AI tool (such as ChatGPT) as a thinking partner to help you clarify your ideas — not as a source of information. The goal is to have the AI ask you questions and help you notice themes, not to give you ready-made answers.</p>
        <p>Start a new chat with the AI and paste a version of this prompt:</p>
        <blockquote>
          "Help me clarify the main points for a research paper I'm writing. I will explain what I've learned from my sources so far. Your job is to ask me questions that help me figure out themes, connections, and main points—but do NOT create arguments or claims for me. Only ask questions or help me sort my own ideas. My topic is: [your topic]. Here is what I've learned so far: [explain in your own words]."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Then continue the conversation by answering the AI's questions and thinking through your ideas based on your research.</p>
        <p><b>What to submit:</b> A copy/paste of the conversation or a clearly readable screenshot (saved as a PDF or Word document is preferred).</p>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <!--  PART 2                                                      -->
    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <h2 id="part2">Part 2: Working Outline</h2>
    <p>Using the thinking you did in Part 1, create a simple working outline that you will continue developing as you draft your paper. This outline should be flexible and in-progress, not a polished final version.</p>

    <p>Your outline must include:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><b>Field/Career:</b> Remind me of the field or career you are focusing on.</li>

      <li><b>Topic / Working Thesis:</b> Write a rough working thesis or purpose statement.<br/>
        <em>(What about AI in your field do you plan to explore, explain, or argue?)</em>
      </li>

      <li><b>Numbered List of Possible Subtopics:</b>
        <p>Create a numbered list of 2–4 major points or sections that might appear in your paper. These should come from your freewrite, Big 3 responses, or AI conversation from Part 1.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>Sources Under Each Subtopic:</b>
        <p>Under each numbered subtopic, briefly list which sources might support that point. This may include scholarly articles, news articles, and social media posts or comments. You will eventually get these sources "in conversation" with each other as you draft. You are not required to fully integrate them yet.</p>
      </li>

      <li><b>AI Transparency Statement:</b>
        <p>At the bottom of your outline, include a transparency statement that explains whether you used AI for this assignment. See more information below.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Optional AI use — collapsed -->
    <details>
      <summary>Using AI for Part 2 (Optional — expand for details)</summary>
      <div class="details-content">
        <p>You may use AI to help you think through and organize your outline, but the final outline must reflect your own decisions and your understanding of your research.</p>
        <p>If you use AI during this part:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask the AI to generate <b>two different outline options</b> based on your ideas from Part 1.</li>
          <li>You may choose one, combine parts of both, or revise the AI-generated outlines in any way you need to make them fit your research. You do not need to accept either outline as-is.</li>
          <li>Your finished outline should clearly be the product of your own thinking, not a copied AI output.</li>
          <li>Submit the prompt(s) you used and the AI-generated outline options along with your final outline.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </details>

    <!-- AI Transparency Statement -->
    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h3>Required: AI Transparency Statement</h3>
      <p>All students must include a brief AI Transparency Statement at the bottom of their outline, whether you used AI or not. Just explain:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>whether you used AI for any part of this assignment (Part 1 or Part 2), and</li>
        <li>if you did, how you used it (1–2 sentences).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Examples:</b></p>
      <p><em>"I used ChatGPT to generate two possible outline structures after completing Part 1. I combined parts of both outlines and revised them to match my research."</em></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><em>"I did not use AI for this assignment."</em></p>

        All requirements for the assignment are met: Part 1 is fully completed using one of the three options; Part 2 includes all required items and an AI Transparency Statement is included. If AI was used for Part 2, the AI prompts and outline options are submitted along with the revised outline.

        Most requirements are met, but something is incomplete (for example: Part 1 is very minimal, the outline is missing key elements, sources are not clearly connected to subtopics, the AI Transparency Statement is missing or unclear, or AI-related materials are not submitted when AI was used).
