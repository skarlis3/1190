    <h1>How to Read a Scholarly Article</h1>
    <h2>A Practical Guide for First-Year College Students</h2>

    <div class="indented-text">
  <p><em>The following guide is based on: Subramanyam, R.V. (2013). Art of reading a journal article: Methodically and effectively. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, 17(1), 65–70. <a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/0973-029X.110733">https://doi.org/10.4103/0973-029X.110733</a></em></p>

    <p>Scholarly articles can feel overwhelming at first — they're dense, full of specialized language, and structured very differently from anything you've probably read before. The good news is that you don't have to read them the way you'd read a novel or a news article. There's a method to it, and once you learn the method, it gets much easier and faster.</p>

    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h3>The Golden Rule</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;"><strong>Never read a scholarly article from beginning to end like a story.</strong> Start with the title, abstract, and conclusion. Then decide whether the rest is worth your time — and if it is, read it in chunks, not straight through.</p>

    <h2 id="types">Types of Scholarly Articles</h2>

    <p>Not everything published in a scholarly journal is the same kind of writing. Knowing what type of article you're looking at helps you understand what to expect from it and how to read it. Here are the most common types you'll encounter:</p>

    <p><strong>Original research articles</strong> report the results of a new study. These follow a predictable structure — introduction, methods, results, and discussion (sometimes called IMRAD) — and they're the most common type you'll be asked to read and cite.</p>

    <p><strong>Review articles</strong>, sometimes called "Literature Reviews" summarize and synthesize existing research on a topic rather than presenting new data. A <em>narrative review</em> gives a broad overview, while a <em>systematic review</em> follows a strict method to find and evaluate all available studies on a specific question. A <em>meta-analysis</em> is a type of systematic review that uses statistics to combine the results of multiple studies.</p>

    <p><strong>Case studies and case series</strong> describe one or a small number of individual cases in detail — for example, an unusual medical condition, a unique teaching situation, or a noteworthy legal outcome.</p>

    <p><strong>Editorials and commentaries</strong> are short pieces in which an author offers their personal opinion or perspective on a topic. These are useful for understanding debates in a field, but they aren't the same as scholarly research.</p>

    <p><strong>Criticism and analysis articles</strong> may also be found in some fields, like literary studies, film studies, and other humanities. These are a type of original research articles that look at new interpretations of literature, film, historical documents, etc. You will not be using these sources for this class, but you may run across them in other classes.</p>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Why Does This Matter?</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">When an assignment asks you to find a "scholarly article" or "peer-reviewed source," your instructor usually means an original research article or a review article — not an editorial or a letter to the editor. If you're unsure, ask.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <h2 id="before-you-read">Before You Read: Decide If It's Worth Your Time</h2>

    <p>You will find far more articles than you can actually read. Before committing to a full article, do a quick skim to see if it's relevant and useful. This should only take a few minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Read the Title</h3>
    <p>A good title tells you what the study is about, what was studied, and sometimes how. If the title has nothing to do with your topic, move on. If it seems relevant, keep going.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Read the Abstract</h3>
    <p>The abstract is a short summary (usually 150–300 words) at the very top of the article. Most abstracts in research articles are structured with labeled sections — background, methods, results, and conclusion — so you can quickly scan for the parts you care about. As you read, ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What question was the study trying to answer?</li>
      <li>How did they try to answer it?</li>
      <li>What did they find?</li>
      <li>Is this relevant to what I need?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Read the Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Skip to the end of the article and read the conclusion (sometimes it's the last paragraph of the Discussion section rather than its own section). This tells you what the authors think their findings mean. Between the abstract and the conclusion, you now have a solid sense of the article's argument without having read the full thing.</p>

    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h3>At This Point, Ask Yourself</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Is this article relevant to my topic? Does it help answer a question I have? If <strong>yes</strong>, read the full article using the approach below. If <strong>no</strong>, set it aside and move on to the next one. There's no shame in skipping an article — that's a normal part of the research process.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <h2 id="parts">The Parts of a Research Article (and What to Look For)</h2>

    <p>If you've decided the article is worth reading in full, here's what each section does and what to pay attention to as you read.</p>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The introduction explains <em>why</em> the study was done. It reviews what's already known about the topic, identifies a gap or unanswered question, and explains how this study addresses that gap. The research question or hypothesis is usually stated at the very end of this section.</p>

    <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> What gap in knowledge is the study trying to fill? What is the specific research question or hypothesis? Does the background information help you understand the context?</p>

    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>The methods section describes <em>how</em> the study was carried out — who or what was studied, what procedures were used, and how data was collected and analyzed. This section can be very technical, and you may not understand every detail. That's okay.</p>

    <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> How many participants or subjects were included? What did the researchers actually do? Were the methods appropriate for the question being asked? You don't need to understand every statistical technique — focus on the overall design.</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>The results section presents the data the study produced, often through tables, figures, and graphs. Ideally, this section reports what was found without interpreting what it means — that comes in the discussion.</p>

    <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> What were the main findings? Look at the tables and figures — they often summarize the most important data more clearly than the text. Were the results statistically significant? (Look for <em>p</em>-values, usually reported as something like <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05.)</p>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>A Note on "Significance"</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">"Statistically significant" means the result is unlikely to be due to chance alone. But that doesn't automatically mean the result is important or meaningful in the real world. Keep an eye out for whether the authors discuss the <em>practical</em> significance of their findings, not just the statistical kind.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>The discussion is where the authors interpret their results — what the findings mean, how they compare to other studies, and what the limitations of the study are. This is often the most useful section for understanding the "so what?" of the research.</p>

    <p><strong>What to look for:</strong> How do the authors explain their results? Do they compare their findings to other studies? What limitations do they acknowledge? What do they suggest for future research? Remember that the discussion represents the <em>authors' interpretations</em>, which are informed opinions — not established facts.</p>

    <h3>Sub-Topic Sections (Review Articles, Literature Reviews, and Meta-Analyses)</h3>
    <p>Not every scholarly article follows the clean IMRAD structure described above. Review articles, literature reviews, and meta-analyses often replace the standard Methods/Results/Discussion format with a series of <strong>sub-topic sections</strong>, each with its own heading. Instead of one big discussion, the authors break the article into themed chunks — each one covering a different aspect of the larger topic.</p>

    <p>For example, a literature review on social media's effects on mental health might have sections like "Self-Comparison and Body Image," "Sleep Disruption," "Cyberbullying," and "Positive Uses of Social Media" — each reviewing the relevant research on that sub-topic before moving on to the next.</p>

    <p>This can actually make these articles <em>easier</em> to work with once you know what to expect, because you can use the section headings to jump straight to the parts most relevant to your own research question rather than reading the entire article front to back.</p>

    <p><strong>How to read these articles:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Start the same way.</strong> Read the title, abstract, and conclusion first — the screening process doesn't change.</li>
      <li><strong>Scan the section headings.</strong> Before reading anything else, scroll through the article and look at all the sub-topic headings. This gives you a map of the article's structure and helps you identify which sections are relevant to your needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Read the introduction.</strong> In these articles, the introduction usually explains the scope of the review — what questions it's trying to answer and how the authors decided which studies to include.</li>
      <li><strong>Read the sub-topic sections that matter to you.</strong> You don't necessarily need to read every section. If only two out of six sub-topics relate to your research question, focus on those two. Read them carefully, paying attention to which studies the authors cite and what patterns or disagreements they identify across the research.</li>
      <li><strong>Read the overall conclusion or synthesis.</strong> Most review articles end with a section that pulls the sub-topics together — summarizing the big picture, identifying gaps in the research, or suggesting directions for future study. This is usually the most valuable part of the article for understanding the current state of knowledge on the topic.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Use Review Articles as Research Shortcuts</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Because review articles and literature reviews summarize and cite <em>many</em> other studies, they're one of the best tools for finding additional sources. If an author mentions a study that sounds relevant to your topic, go to the reference list, find that citation, and look it up. One good review article can lead you to a dozen useful sources.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Conclusion (One More Time)</h3>
    <p>You already read the conclusion during your initial screening. Now read it again. After going through the full article, the conclusion should make more sense and you should be able to assess whether the evidence in the article actually supports it.</p>

    <h3>References</h3>
    <p>Don't skip the reference list entirely. If you found this article useful, scanning the references is one of the best ways to find <em>more</em> useful articles on the same topic. Look for titles that seem relevant and track those articles down.</p>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <h2 id="putting-it-together">Putting It All Together</h2>

    <p>Here's the full reading process in order:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Read the title.</strong> Is it relevant to your topic?</li>
      <li><strong>Read the abstract.</strong> What was studied, how, and what was found?</li>
      <li><strong>Read the conclusion.</strong> What do the authors say it all means?</li>
      <li><strong>Decide:</strong> Is this article worth reading in full?</li>
      <li>If yes: <strong>Read the introduction</strong> for background and the research question.</li>
      <li><strong>Read the methods</strong> to understand how the study was designed.</li>
      <li><strong>Read the results</strong>, paying attention to tables, figures, and key findings.</li>
      <li><strong>Read the discussion</strong> for interpretation, comparisons, and limitations.</li>
      <li><strong>Re-read the conclusion</strong> to confirm your understanding.</li>
      <li><strong>Scan the references</strong> for additional sources.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>It Gets Easier</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">The first few articles you read this way will feel slow. That's normal. The more you practice this process, the faster you'll get at identifying what matters and what you can skim. You're building a skill, not just completing a task.</p>
