    <h1>How to Annotate a PDF</h1>
    <h2>Highlighting, Commenting, and Submitting Annotated Articles</h2>

    <p>For some assignments in this class, you'll need to annotate scholarly articles directly on the PDF — highlighting key passages, adding comments, and writing notes. This guide covers what to annotate, how to do it on whatever device you have, and how to make sure your annotations are saved when you submit.</p>

    <h2 id="what-to-annotate">What to Annotate (and Why)</h2>

    <p>Annotating isn't just highlighting everything that looks important. The goal is to have a conversation with the text — marking the parts that matter and writing down your thinking as you read. When you come back to the article later (for a paper, a discussion, or a project), your annotations become a record of what you noticed and what you were thinking.</p>

    <p>Here are some things worth marking or commenting on as you read:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Main arguments or claims</strong> — What is the author's central point? What are they trying to convince you of?</li>
      <li><strong>Key findings or data</strong> — What did the study actually find? What numbers or results stand out?</li>
      <li><strong>Definitions or key terms</strong> — If the author defines a concept that's central to the article, mark it. You'll want to find it again.</li>
      <li><strong>Connections to other things you've read</strong> — Does this remind you of something from a news article, a social media post, or another scholarly source? Note the connection.</li>
      <li><strong>Things that confuse you</strong> — If a sentence or section doesn't make sense, mark it and write a quick note about what's unclear. You can come back to it, ask about it in class, or look it up.</li>
      <li><strong>Things that surprise you or that you disagree with</strong> — Your reactions matter. If something catches you off guard or you're skeptical, write that down.</li>
      <li><strong>Questions you want to explore further</strong> — Good research generates more questions. Capture them as they come up.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Your Annotations Don't Need to Be Formal</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Write in your natural voice. "Wait, this contradicts what the NYT article said" or "I don't understand what this variable means" are perfectly good annotations. The point is to show that you're reading, thinking, and engaging — not to write polished paragraphs.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="computer">Annotating on a Computer (PC or Mac)</h2>

    <p>You have several free options for annotating PDFs on a computer. Pick whichever one you already have or feels most comfortable.</p>

    <h3>Adobe Acrobat Reader (Free — PC and Mac)</h3>

    <p>Adobe Acrobat Reader is free and works on both PC and Mac. If you don't already have it, you can download it from <a href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/">get.adobe.com/reader</a>. Make sure you download the free <strong>Acrobat Reader</strong>, not the paid Acrobat Pro — Reader is all you need.</p>

    <p><strong>To highlight text:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your PDF in Acrobat Reader.</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Highlight</strong> tool from the toolbar at the top (it looks like a marker pen). If you don't see it, look under the <strong>Comment</strong> or <strong>Markup</strong> menu.</li>
      <li>Click and drag across the text you want to highlight.</li>
      <li>To change the highlight color, right-click (or Control-click on Mac) the highlighted text and choose <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>To add a comment:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Highlight a passage first, then <strong>double-click</strong> the highlight to open a comment box. Type your note there.</li>
      <li>Or, use the <strong>Sticky Note</strong> tool (speech bubble icon) from the toolbar to place a comment anywhere on the page.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>To add a note at the top of the PDF</strong> (for the short annotation your assignment requires):</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the <strong>Sticky Note</strong> tool and click at the very top of the first page.</li>
      <li>Type your 1–2 sentence note about how the article relates to your research topic.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>To save:</strong> Press <strong>Ctrl + S</strong> (PC) or <strong>⌘ Cmd + S</strong> (Mac). Your annotations are saved directly into the PDF file.</p>

    <h3>Microsoft Edge (Free — PC and Mac)</h3>

    <p>If you don't want to install anything, Microsoft Edge has a built-in PDF reader with annotation tools. This is especially convenient on Windows PCs where Edge is already installed.</p>

    <p><strong>To highlight and comment:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Right-click your PDF file and choose <strong>Open with → Microsoft Edge</strong>.</li>
      <li>A toolbar will appear at the top of the PDF. Select the <strong>Highlight</strong> tool (marker icon) and drag across text to highlight it.</li>
      <li>To add a comment, highlight some text first, then right-click the highlight and choose <strong>Add comment</strong>.</li>
      <li>You can also use the <strong>Text comment</strong> tool (if available) or the <strong>Draw</strong> tool to write or circle things freehand.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>To save:</strong> Click the <strong>Save</strong> icon (floppy disk) in the toolbar, or press <strong>Ctrl + S</strong>. Choose <strong>"Save as"</strong> if you want to keep the original PDF unchanged and save an annotated copy.</p>

    <h3>Preview (Free — Mac Only)</h3>

    <p>Preview comes pre-installed on every Mac. It's simple and works well for basic annotation.</p>

    <p><strong>To highlight text:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the PDF in Preview (this is usually the default when you double-click a PDF on a Mac).</li>
      <li>If the Markup toolbar isn't showing, click the <strong>pen-tip icon</strong> near the top-right of the window (or go to <strong>View → Show Markup Toolbar</strong>).</li>
      <li>Select the <strong>Highlight</strong> tool (marker icon) and drag across text.</li>
      <li>To change the color, click the small dropdown arrow next to the highlight icon.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>To add a comment:</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Highlight a passage, then right-click (or Control-click) the highlight and choose <strong>"Add Note"</strong>.</li>
      <li>A small note icon will appear — click it to open the note and type your comment.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>To save:</strong> Press <strong>⌘ Cmd + S</strong>. Preview saves annotations directly into the PDF. If you want to keep the original untouched, use <strong>File → Export as PDF</strong> to save an annotated copy.</p>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Google Drive as a Backup Option</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">If you upload a PDF to Google Drive, you can open it with <strong>Google Docs</strong> and add comments. However, this sometimes reformats the article and can make the layout messy. It works in a pinch, but the tools above will give you better results and keep your PDF looking clean.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->
    <!--  TABLETS                                                     -->
    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <h2 id="tablets">Annotating on a Tablet (iPad or Android)</h2>

    <p>Tablets are actually great for annotating PDFs, especially if you have a stylus. You can highlight and write notes directly on the document like you would with a printed article and a pen.</p>

    <h3>iPad — Built-In Markup</h3>

    <p>Every iPad can annotate PDFs using Apple's built-in Markup tools through the Files app. No extra apps needed.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Save your PDF to the <strong>Files</strong> app (or open it from Google Drive/email and tap <strong>"Save to Files"</strong>).</li>
      <li>Open the PDF in the <strong>Files</strong> app.</li>
      <li>Tap the <strong>Markup icon</strong> (a pen-tip in a circle) in the top-right corner.</li>
      <li>Use the <strong>pen, highlighter, or pencil tools</strong> at the bottom to draw or highlight directly on the page.</li>
      <li>To add a typed comment: tap the <strong>+</strong> button in the Markup toolbar and choose <strong>"Text"</strong> to add a text box, or choose <strong>"Signature"</strong> → <strong>"Add or Remove Signature"</strong> (not ideal — see the app recommendation below for better commenting).</li>
      <li>When you're done, tap <strong>Done</strong>. Your annotations are saved into the PDF.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Limitation of Built-In Markup</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Apple's Markup tools are great for freehand highlighting and drawing, especially with an Apple Pencil. But they don't support sticky-note-style typed comments very well. If you want to type comments (rather than handwrite them), use one of the free apps recommended below.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Android Tablet — Google Drive</h3>

    <p>Android doesn't have a built-in PDF annotation tool as polished as Apple's, but Google Drive offers basic annotation if your PDF is stored there.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Upload your PDF to <strong>Google Drive</strong> (or save it there from your browser).</li>
      <li>Open the PDF in the Google Drive app.</li>
      <li>Tap the <strong>comment icon</strong> or select text and choose <strong>"Add comment"</strong> from the menu that appears.</li>
      <li>Type your note and tap the send arrow to save it.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Google Drive's annotation tools are limited — you can add comments, but highlighting and freehand markup aren't well supported. For a better experience, use the free app recommendation below.</p>

    <h3>Recommended Free App: PDF Markup (Both iPad and Android)</h3>

    <p>For the best tablet annotation experience, especially if you want both highlighting <em>and</em> typed comments, download a free PDF annotation app. A few solid options:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Adobe Acrobat Reader</strong> (free — iPad and Android): The mobile version of the same tool described in the computer section above. Supports highlighting, sticky notes, text comments, and freehand drawing. This is the most reliable free option across both platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>PDF Expert</strong> (free with limitations — iPad): Very smooth highlighting and commenting. The free version covers everything you need for class.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The process in these apps is similar across the board:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your PDF in the app.</li>
      <li>Use the <strong>highlight tool</strong> to select and highlight text.</li>
      <li>Tap a highlighted passage and choose <strong>"Add Note"</strong> or <strong>"Comment"</strong> to type a note.</li>
      <li>Use the <strong>sticky note</strong> tool to add comments anywhere on the page.</li>
      <li>Save or export the PDF when you're done — make sure your annotations are included in the saved file.</li>
    </ol>

    <!-- ============================================================ -->

    <h2 id="saving">Saving and Submitting Your Annotated PDF</h2>

    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h3>The Most Important Step</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Before you submit, <strong>open your saved PDF and check that your annotations are actually visible.</strong> Some tools save annotations in a way that only shows up in that specific app. Open the file in a different viewer (or email it to yourself and open it on another device) to make sure your highlights and comments survived the save. If they didn't, try using <strong>"Export"</strong> or <strong>"Save a Copy"</strong> rather than a regular save — this flattens the annotations into the file.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Checklist Before Submitting</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Open the PDF</strong> you're about to submit and scroll through it.</li>
      <li>Confirm that your <strong>highlights</strong> are visible on the pages.</li>
      <li>Confirm that your <strong>comments and notes</strong> appear (click or tap on highlights to check for attached notes).</li>
      <li>Confirm that your <strong>short annotation at the top of the first page</strong> is there (your 1–2 sentence note about how the article relates to your research).</li>
      <li><strong>Upload the PDF to Canvas.</strong> Do not copy and paste text into the Canvas text box — submit the actual PDF file with annotations.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Naming Your Files</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom:0;">Name your files clearly so it's obvious what they are — for example, "Smith-2024-AI-Healthcare-Annotated.pdf" is much easier to work with than "download(3).pdf." This helps both you and your instructor.</p>
