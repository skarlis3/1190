    // Modal content data
    const modalData = {
      topic: {
        title: "Your Research Topic",
        examples: "Your research topic is the central focus connecting all your sources. For this project, you're exploring how AI is impacting your planned major or field.",
        why: "A well-defined topic helps you determine which voices and perspectives you need for a complete picture. As you research, your topic may evolve—this is normal and often a sign of deepening understanding.",
        isCenter: true
      },
      community: {
        title: "Community Voices",
        examples: "<strong>What are they?</strong> People directly affected by or involved in your topic—firsthand perspectives often missing from institutional sources. This includes social media posts sharing lived experiences, interviews with community members, personal blogs or podcasts, testimonials, and letters to editors.",
        why: "<strong>Why include them?</strong> Community voices provide authenticity and ground-level perspective. They help answer: \"What is this actually like for real people?\" For AI research, these might be workers discussing how AI tools changed their jobs, students sharing experiences with AI tutoring, or professionals posting about AI in their field."
      },
      news: {
        title: "News Media",
        examples: "<strong>What are they?</strong> Sources that report on current events and provide journalistic perspectives. This includes newspaper and magazine articles (including tech publications like Wired, MIT Technology Review, or Ars Technica), broadcast news segments, documentaries, and investigative journalism.",
        why: "<strong>Why include them?</strong> For fast-moving fields like AI, news sources are essential for staying current. A journal article about AI published today may have been written 1–2 years ago—an eternity in AI development. News fills that gap, covering breakthroughs and real-world applications months before scholarly articles appear. Just note the difference between news reporting and opinion/editorial content."
      },
      academic: {
        title: "Academic Voices",
        examples: "<strong>What are they?</strong> Scholarly conversation about your topic—research reviewed and vetted by other experts. This includes peer-reviewed journal articles, scholarly books, conference papers, and dissertations. Use library databases like EBSCO or Google Scholar to find them.",
        why: "<strong>Why include them?</strong> These sources provide theoretical frameworks, research methodologies, and evidence-based analysis. While they may lag behind current AI developments, they offer depth, rigor, and the broader context that news coverage often lacks."
      },
      ngo: {
        title: "Non-Government Organization Reports",
        examples: "<strong>What are they?</strong> Research and reports from organizations operating independently of government. This includes advocacy groups (ACLU, Electronic Frontier Foundation), think tanks (Brookings, RAND), professional associations, and nonprofit research organizations.",
        why: "<strong>Why include them?</strong> NGOs often focus on specific issues in depth. For AI research, organizations like the AI Now Institute or Partnership on AI produce valuable reports. Remember that NGOs typically have missions or agendas—understanding their perspective helps you evaluate their information critically."
      },
      government: {
        title: "Government Reports",
        examples: "<strong>What are they?</strong> Official data, statistics, policies, and publicly funded research at various levels. This includes agency reports (FTC, EEOC, Department of Labor), congressional hearings and records, executive orders, and international bodies like the EU or UN.",
        why: "<strong>Why include them?</strong> Government sources provide reliable data and official positions on AI regulation, workforce impacts, and policy directions. They represent institutional perspectives and may reveal how AI is being addressed (or not) at the policy level in your field."
      },
      stakeholders: {
        title: "Stakeholders & Allies",
        examples: "<strong>What are they?</strong> People or groups not primarily affected by your topic but still invested in or impacted by it. If researching AI in healthcare, stakeholders might include insurance companies, hospital administrators, or medical educators—not just doctors and patients.",
        why: "<strong>Why include them?</strong> These perspectives reveal the broader impact and context of AI beyond those most directly involved. They help you understand the ecosystem around your topic and anticipate how changes might ripple outward."
