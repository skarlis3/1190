    <h1>Popular &amp; Professional News</h1>

    <p>News articles are one of the most common sources you'll use when researching current topics. Not all news sources work the same way, though — and knowing the difference can help you find better information and evaluate it more carefully. This reading covers two types of news sources you'll use for this assignment: <strong>popular news</strong> and <strong>professional organization news</strong>.</p>

    <p>For a broader overview of how news fits into the landscape of sources, see the <a href="popular-scholarly.html">Popular vs. Scholarly Sources</a> reading.</p>

    <h2 id="popular-news">Popular News</h2>

    <p>Popular news articles are written by journalists — professional writers whose job is to research and report on topics for a general audience. Journalists are skilled at gathering information and presenting it clearly, but they are not typically experts in the fields they cover.</p>

    <p>A journalist writing about AI in healthcare, for example, may interview doctors and researchers — but they are reporting on what experts say, not speaking as an expert themselves.</p>

    <p>News articles also vary a lot in depth. Longer investigative pieces may involve weeks of research and multiple expert sources. Shorter headline news articles — the kind you'll often find at the top of a search results page — tend to stay surface-level, summarizing a topic quickly without going into much detail. As you read, pay attention to how much depth an article actually has.</p>

    <h3 id="finding-popular-news">Finding Popular News Articles</h3>

    <p>You can use either or both of these methods — trying both will give you more results to choose from.</p>

    <h4>Method 1: Search a news site directly</h4>

    <p>These three sources are reliable and free to access:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AP News</strong> — <a href="https://apnews.com">apnews.com</a></li>
      <li><strong>Reuters</strong> — <a href="https://reuters.com">reuters.com</a></li>
      <li><strong>NPR News</strong> — <a href="https://npr.org/news">npr.org</a></li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to one of the sites above.</li>
      <li>Use the search bar on the site to search for your topic using the keyword formula below.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Method 2: Search Google or Bing and filter by News</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> or <a href="https://bing.com">Bing</a>.</li>
      <li>Type your search terms into the search bar.</li>
      <li>Press Enter to run the search.</li>
      <li>Look for the row of tabs near the top of the results page — you will see options like <strong>All</strong>, <strong>Images</strong>, <strong>Videos</strong>, and <strong>News</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>News</strong> to filter your results to news articles only.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="search-keywords">Search Keywords</h3>

    <p>When searching, use your job title or field combined with a keyword about AI. The basic formula is:</p>

    <div class="glance-accent-box">
      <h4>Keyword Formula</h4>
      <p><strong>[job title or field] + [AI keyword]</strong></p>
      <p>Try a few different combinations — sometimes one phrasing returns much better results than another.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ultrasound technician artificial intelligence</li>
        <li>Ultrasound tech AI</li>
        <li>Nursing artificial intelligence</li>
        <li>AI patient care nursing</li>
        <li>Criminal justice AI</li>
        <li>Artificial intelligence law enforcement</li>
        <li>Culinary industry artificial intelligence</li>
        <li>AI restaurants</li>
        <li>Cybersecurity artificial intelligence</li>
        <li>AI network security</li>
        <li>Early childhood education AI</li>
        <li>Artificial intelligence childcare</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 id="professional-news">Professional Organization News</h2>

    <p>Professional organizations are groups made up of people who work in the same field or career. They share news, set standards, offer training, and advocate for people in that profession. Almost every field has at least one — sometimes several.</p>

    <p>Unlike popular news, professional organization news is written <em>for</em> people already working in or studying a field, and it is reviewed and published by people with expertise in that field. This means the coverage tends to be more specific, more technical, and more directly relevant to practitioners than what you'd find in a general news outlet.</p>

    <p>Professional organization news also tends to be research-informed — articles often reference studies, data, or policy developments — even though the articles themselves are reporting on those things rather than presenting original research. In this way, professional organization news sits somewhere between popular news and scholarly articles.</p>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Keep in Mind: Advocacy &amp; Bias</h3>
      <p>Because professional organizations represent and advocate for people in their field, their news coverage may reflect a particular perspective or position on an issue. This doesn't make these sources unreliable — it just means it's worth being aware of where the organization stands as you read and evaluate sources.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="finding-professional-news">Finding Professional Organization News</h3>

    <h4>Step 1: Find the professional organization(s) in your field</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to <a href="https://google.com">Google</a> or <a href="https://bing.com">Bing</a>.</li>
      <li>Type your field or career title into the search bar using one of these formulas:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>[your field or career] + professional organization</strong><br/>
            Example: <em>nursing professional organization</em> or <em>culinary arts professional organization</em></li>
          <li><strong>[your field or career] + professional association</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Press Enter to run the search.</li>
      <li>Look through your results for websites that:
        <ul>
          <li>End in <strong>.org</strong></li>
          <li>Have words like <em>Association</em>, <em>Society</em>, <em>Council</em>, <em>Federation</em>, or <em>Institute</em> in the name</li>
          <li>Have an "About" page describing who their members are</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Click on a result that looks promising and confirm it is actually a professional organization by checking:
        <ul>
          <li>Does it have a membership section?</li>
          <li>Does it describe representing or serving people in your field?</li>
          <li>Does it publish news, resources, or policy updates?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>You may find more than one professional organization in your field — that's completely fine, and can actually be helpful. Different organizations sometimes cover different aspects of the field or take different perspectives on issues like AI. You can use more than one for this assignment.</p>

    <p>Some fields have one large, broad organization and several smaller, more specialized ones. In nursing, for example, the American Nurses Association (ANA) covers the whole profession, while organizations like the Emergency Nurses Association or the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses focus on specific practice areas.</p>

    <p>If your program is specialized — like Surgical Technology, Dental Hygiene, or Respiratory Therapy — you may find that a smaller, focused organization is more useful than a broader one. Or you might use both. The tip below can help you figure out what's out there in your field.</p>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h4>Using AI to Assist</h4>
      <p>Finding the right professional organization can be tricky, especially if your field has several. This is a good place to use a GenAI tool — like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini — to help you get oriented.</p>
      <p>Try asking something like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>"What are the major professional organizations for ultrasound technicians?"</em></li>
        <li><em>"What professional associations exist for people working in criminal justice?"</em></li>
        <li><em>"Are there multiple professional organizations for nurses, and what is each one focused on?"</em></li>
      </ul>
      <p>A GenAI tool can give you a quick overview of what organizations exist and what each one focuses on, which can help you decide where to start. Once you have some names, use the steps above to find and verify them — GenAI can occasionally get details wrong, so always confirm by visiting the organization's actual website.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Step 2: Find AI news on the organization's website</h4>

    <p>Once you have found a professional organization in your field, you can look for AI-related news in two ways:</p>

    <h5>Method 1: Browse the site's news section</h5>

    <ol>
      <li>Look at the navigation menu at the top of the page.</li>
      <li>Look for a tab or section labeled <strong>News</strong>, <strong>Newsroom</strong>, <strong>Publications</strong>, <strong>Blog</strong>, or <strong>Policy Updates</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click into that section and browse for articles related to AI or technology in your field.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Method 2: Search the organization's website directly</h5>

    <ol>
      <li>Look for a search bar on the organization's website — it is usually in the top right corner of the page.</li>
      <li>Type in search terms like:
        <ul>
          <li><em>artificial intelligence</em></li>
          <li><em>AI</em></li>
          <li><em>automation</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Browse the results for relevant articles.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="questions">Questions to Ask as You Read</h2>

    <p>As you read your articles — whether popular news or professional organization news — keep these questions in the back of your mind. You'll be answering versions of them in the assignment:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Is this a news report or an opinion piece? How can you tell?</li>
      <li>How deep does this article go? Does it cite research, experts, or data — or does it stay surface-level?</li>
      <li>Who is the intended audience for this article?</li>
      <li>Does the source have a particular perspective or stake in this topic?</li>
      <li>How does this article connect to others you've read?</li>
    </ul>
